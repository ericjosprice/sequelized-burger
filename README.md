# Project Name - Eat-Da-Burger
Description: Creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Following the MVC design pattern and using Node + MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.
Designed to be used as a communication tool for fellow developers in the community and potential employers. 

# Usage
1) Eat-Da-Burger is a burger app that allows users input a description of burgers they'd like to eat.
2) Whenever a user submits a burger description, the app will store the description in the database and display the description on the page. users will also see a button to devour the burger
3) Burgers are in a waiting to be devoured state. When the user clicks the devour button, the burger moves into a new category area on the page, devoured
4) Eat-Da-Burger stores every burger in the database regardless of whether or not it's been devoured.
